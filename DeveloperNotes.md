# Developer Notes

* While the QuantizedMesh class has read/write capabilities for the quantized mesh format with both oct-encoded per-vertex normals and water masks, the quantized mesh tiles generated by qm_tiler do not include the water mask. 

## Issues to take into account when implementing the quantized-mesh format
* The vertices and indices need to be optimized for both cache and fetching to be suitable for highwatermark encoding. We use a slightly modified version of the meshoptimizer library (https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer) to perform these steps.
